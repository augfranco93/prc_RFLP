# prc_RFLP
This repository contains a code to simulate a PCR-RLFP (Restriction fragment length polymorphism). The objective is to try to identify which is the "best" restriction enzyme for bacteria species identification. 

# Scripts:
prc_rflp_inSilico.py - Code to create restriction fragments using bactome library from python. 

pcrRFLP-Plot.R - Script to simulate a gel electrophoresis.
